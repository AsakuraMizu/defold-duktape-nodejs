# NodeJS wrapper & example for Defold Duktape

**NOT FINISHED**

The [packages/core](packages/core) folder contains a basic wrapper for Defold Duktape.

The [examples/Movement tutorial](examples/Movement%20tutorial) folder contains an example of using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as programming language and [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) as build system. And this can be easily turned into a JavaScript project if you want.

I'm busy with my schoolwork, so this project will be delayed. Sorry for that.
